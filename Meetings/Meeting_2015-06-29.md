## Notes

### What have been done since last time

	* Finished authentication with github and persistence in neo4j

* **Jacob**
	* Looked at [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/)

### Ideas
* Ask people that are signing up to add badges in their public repos.
* We could use parallele coordinates to build a bar code that could represent the identity of a repository.

### Next steps
* **Thomas:**
	* Use the actor model to save scores in the userDAO and propagates scores.

* **Nicolas**
	* Add to the profile: email, gravatar and name
	* Circle ci memory problem continue to exchange with circle-ci crew. Look into sleep
	* Code DAO for repository persistence
	* Design the graph model for the scores, karma and the repos.

* **Jacob**
	* Make prototypes for docker storage.
	* Mount MySql and the data volume with /data
	* Compare database Neo4j, MySql and Postgres
	* Look what is possible for deployment
