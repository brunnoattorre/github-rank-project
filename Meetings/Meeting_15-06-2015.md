# Meeting - 15/06/2015

## Metadata

**Place:** Skype

**Contributors:**

* Jacob Tardieu
* Thomas Pocreau
* Nicolas Joseph

**Goal:** Talk about the advancement made to the project, the rating process, an the next moves.

## Notes
### What have been done since last time
* **Thomas:**
	* Test of Pymc conclusion is that we should display on a repo the distribution of ratings for each criteria along the meta computed score
	* Finishing the [scoring simulation](https://github.com/gitlinks/notebooks/blob/master/Karma%20and%20Score%20Simulation.ipynb)
	* Looked at [slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) for the link with the database but it is only for relationnal database and we are going for neo4j
	* Thought of the modelisation of rating propagation through actors for repos and users.

* **Nicolas**
	* Started to look at [Openshift v3](http://www.openshift.org/) (Paas), installed docker on our testing server (git-rank.net thanks to [Alexis Schadoc](https://github.com/schadocalex))
	* Started the integration of [silhouette](http://silhouette.mohiva.com/v3.0/docs) for the github OAuth2 authentication of the project with the use of [scala-guice](https://github.com/codingwell/scala-guice)
	* Link with [AnormCypher](http://www.anormcypher.org/) and the Neo4j database on the way
	* Looked for the badge system. Use of [shield.io](http://shields.io/)
	* Some work on [how to get data with the github API](https://github.com/gitlinks/notebooks/blob/master/Github%20API%20ipython%20v3.ipynb)
	* Started the work on [simulating the scores and karma with their propagation](https://github.com/gitlinks/notebooks/blob/master/Karma%20and%20Score%20Simulation.ipynb)
	* Some [Wireframing](https://precursorapp.com/document/GitRank-repository-view-17592200279569)
	* Dump of angular for GitRank
	* Circle-ci and Codacy for continuous integration and code quality

### Decisions

**Core Project**

* Markov chains are too complicated to implement for now but an approach considering distribution is going to be prototyped
* User and repo nodes in the graph should not contain scores and Karma. Another document will hold them (Have an history)
* Settled on some rating criterias for the repos:
	* Documentation (quantity and quality)
	* Support (How quick do I get help, quality of help)
	* Design (is the project easy to use)
	* Maturity (is it stable, not buggy)
* Deprecate Karma/Score over time, tie score to a release ? will see in an update
* Having score evolution for the simulation would be helpful.

**Administration**

* We Should use a proper workflow on git: two branch `master`for production and `develop`for dev
* Add Thomas and Jacob to Codacy and Circle-Ci
* Give Jacob ssh access to admin the test server
* We meet every monday at 20:30 if at least two project members are available.
* Use issues to affect tasks

## Next steps

**Jacob**

* Check out Openshift v3 and its install on the test server
* Build the deployement pipeline to the test server from Circle-ci with docker.

**Thomas**

* Improve rate/repo/user generation code for the simulation
* Enable score/karma evolution visualization in the simulation
* Start drafting the actor model for score propagation

**Nicolas**

* Finish authentication and link to the neo4j database.
