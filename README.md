Project to rate quality of github repositories like we vote for cool posts on hacker news

## Ideas
* Use a Karma system to weight votes on github repositories.
* Can use stackoverflow karma in the computation of your karma
* if you have contributed to an upvoted project your karma should benefit from it proportionnaly to your contribution to the project

How is the Karma computed? What is the formula?

How do people vote? Do they make reviews? What are the criteria? Can they leave comments on each criteria?
