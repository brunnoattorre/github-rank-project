# Meeting - 28/07/2015

## Metadata

**Place:** Skype

**Contributors:**

* Jacob Tardieu
* Nicolas Joseph

## Notes
### What have been done since last time

**Nicolas**

  * Update the README with all the information on what we have done up to now.
  * Check the Webhook available for users on GitHub. -> Not available

**Jacob**
  * Did automatic deploy to test server

### Discussions

* No possibility to use webhooks on user. We can't keep contributors contributions up to date lazily. As a consequence we will have to update all contributions actively using the feed API for user on GitHub. (See link below). Let's see if it scales, otherwise, if we get bigger we could ask  user webhooks to github.
* We should look into akka scheduler in order to do this batch task

### Next steps

**Jacob**

* Configure Nginx to expose the application on the web
* Use a subdomain for the deployment webhook on the test server

**Nicolas**

* GetContributor method (finish)
* Complete authentication pipeline with user contributions from github.
* Look at Akka scheduler
* Mock up of the repository page
