## Notes

### Core features:

1. Rate project easily.
2. See project's scores.
3. Owner should be able to see feedbacks easily.

### Target
Developers, technical managers that are looking for insights on project qualities.

### Value
* Enable people to find a good project quickly.
* Enable project owners to have feedback so they can improve.

### Repository Score
* Weight score with user usage of the repository. ie if we can detect that one user has used a project, then we should give more weight to its rating.
* We also should ask a user to review its rating 2 months or so after having rated it for the first time so that he can have a more insightful opinion on a project.
* Dependencies qualities should also affect score

### Karma
* Looking back, people that initialy rated a project accurately should be rewarded by Karma.

### Technologies
* Neo4j
* Play for Scala
* Angular

### Deploy
* Test on online.net
* Production on Openshift

### Bootstrap 
* By hand by rating some well known projects. A good source of project to rate are the one in the [awsome list](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness)
* By using bagdes in the projects we contribute to.
* By going to meetups

## Next steps
