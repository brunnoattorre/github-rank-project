## Notes
### What have been done since last time

**Jacob**
* Automatic docker deployment on dev instance

**Nicolas**

* Navigation between pages
* Test config -> could be renamed dev config
* Redirect after login to current page
* List Feedback in the repository page

**Brunno**

* Karma service
* Added some Unit tests

2 issues mentioned:
- parsing users with jackson not that pretty
- currently recalculating every user's karma.

### Discussions

* Take a look at the way the stream is handled because it could fill the pool very quickly (Make it do one operation at a time)
* Do not prevent edition of votes
* Prevent adding several scores
* Ditch Docker

### Next steps

**Nicolas**

* Finish the link between the repo page and the backend by linking the parallel coordinates to the real data.
* Cleaning the code
* Tests !

**Jacob**

* Add a neo4j on the dev instance and link it to the gitrank container
* Deploy directly without Docker from circle ci and with the configuration file application.test.conf (renamed application.dev.conf)

**Thomas**

* Help Jacob getting the test server running

**Brunno**

* Score submission
* not allowing user to vote on own repo
* Tests

**Karan**
* getting familiar with the dev environment.
