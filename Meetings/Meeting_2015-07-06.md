	* How to store data into containers -> Use of data containers
	* Makefile to deploy containers, for now it deletes everything
	* A data container can be accessed from several other containers

### Ideas
* Try to keep everything in neo4j as long as possible
* OVH has opened a container runner called [SailAbove](https://labs.runabove.com/docker/) that could be used to deploy our app.

* **Thomas:**
	* Use the actor model to save scores in the userDAO and propagates scores.
